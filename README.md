# Graphically Solving a Linear Optimization Problem with Interactive Constraints

This project is a tutorial on how to setup and visually solve a Linear Optimization problem in Python.

Notebooks:
1. Visually-Solving-Linear-Optimization.ipynb
    * This notebook demonstrates how to solve for two decision variables and constraints.

TBA - I will demonstrate how to visually solve for > 2 dimensions using dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
